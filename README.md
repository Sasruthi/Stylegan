# Style-transfer
The goal of neural style transfer is to blend a content image with a style image to produce a new image that retains the content of the first and the style of the second. 
The code performs neural style transfer by extracting features from the content and style images using a pre-trained VGG19 model, computing content and style losses, and iteratively updating the content image to blend the style while retaining the content.
